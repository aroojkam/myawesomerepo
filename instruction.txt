Description of the tasks from HW 2: Step 0 was to set up GitHub and to configure it. This allowed for my GitHub account 
to be connected with my device terminal. Step 1 taught me how to create a repository on GitHub and how to clone it on my 
terminal so i can create changes through my terminal. Step 2 taught me how to make changes to my repository. It taught 
me how to create a files, edit the files, add the changes, and how to commit the changes with a message. I could also 
check the status of my changes using git status. Step 3 taught me how to create a seperate branch from the main and how 
to make changes there and then add them to the main branch. I learned how to make sure teh changes were transfered to my 
GitHub. I also was able to view my commits using git log and how to squash 3 commits into 1. I learned how to switch 
through branches and how to transfer information accross branches. Step 4 taught me how to fork an upstream repository 
to make changes into someone else's repository. Step 5 taught me how to create a pull request and how to solve any 
conflicts.
